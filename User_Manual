""" Muhammet ALGAN - NETSCANNER """
In this code, the get_installed_applications function retrieves the versions of installed applications by executing the dpkg-query command, which lists package
names and versions on Debian-based systems.The output is processed to create a list containing the application names and versions.
and checks for known exploits for the current application versions.

The scan_ports function performs port scanning by sending TCP SYN packets to the specified port range on the target IP address.
Open ports are identified and printed.

The detect_os function sends an ICMP packet to the target IP address and analyzes the response to determine the operating system. 
The TTL value of the response packet is used as an indicator.

The user is prompted to enter the target IP address, starting port, and ending port.
The installed applications' versions, open ports, and detected operating system are then displayed.

The program iterates through the installed applications and calls the check_exploits function for each application to check if there are any known exploits for
its version.



Please note that this code assumes a Debian-based system and uses the dpkg-query command for retrieving installed application information.
If you are using a different operating system, you may need to modify the code to use the appropriate commands or package managers.
